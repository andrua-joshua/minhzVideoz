Minhz videos library management application

Brief info
This is a desktop application developed in java using
 javafx framework for creating the UI.
It's an application for sorting movies and series by searching the through
 the file system of the computer that has the movies and 
 series hence sorting them as a series or movie and also asigning 
 them prices wither per season or movie.

 it also helps cache the search and iteration and movies directories from the 
 computer hence facilitating the search process  of the person using it 
 since it will not be really searching from the file 
 system again but just another serialised data of the search history.

 feel free to clone and run it or even modify
